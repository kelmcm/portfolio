# Assignment: Visualizing government debt
The goal of this assignment is to visualize global government debt over time. Countries take on different forms of government dept. The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is an indicator used to measure the health of a government's finances. In the below exercise we look at this metric from different lenses.   

## Part 1: Government finance sustainability above average for US and Canada - not a good thing
I've lived large portions of my life in Canada and the United States, so I like to compare these contries a lot when looking at data. Taking a peak at the general government debt-to-GDP ratio for 2019, Canada and the US are above average. For this indicator, a good value is below 60%.

## Part 2: Global debt-to-GDP ratio trends upwards over past 3 decades
The below visualization similarly compares the general government debt-to-gdp ratio, howver it now shows the value over time between the years 1995-2021. Each country is shown with an individual sparkline. Sparklines are a nice tool to the trends of many datapoints all at once without overcrowding the visualization because each datapoint has their own mini-chart.
