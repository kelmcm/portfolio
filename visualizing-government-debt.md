## Assignment: Visualizing government debt
The goal of this assignment is to visualize global government debt over time. Countries take on different forms of government debt. The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is an indicator used to measure the health of a government's finances (OECD, 2022). In the below exercise we look at this metric from different lenses.   

### Part 1: Government finance sustainability above average for US and Canada - not a good thing
Our first chart, is a verticle bar chart showing the general governmnet debt-to-ratio by country for 2019. I've lived large portions of my life in Canada and the United States, so I like to compare these contries a lot when looking at data. I've highlighted Canada, the US, and the overall average to draw the readers' eye to this comparison. Taking a peak at the general government debt-to-GDP ratio for 2019, Canada and the US are both above average. For this indicator, a good value is below 60%.

### Part 2: Global debt-to-GDP ratio trends upwards over past 3 decades
The below visualization similarly compares the general government debt-to-GDP ratio, howver it now shows the value over time between the years 1995-2021. Each country is shown with an individual sparkline. Sparklines are a nice tool to the trends of many datapoints all at once without overcrowding the visualization because each datapoint has their own mini-chart. Contrary to the bar chart visualization that shows the metric for one year, sparklines allow the reader to quickly see trends in the debt-to-GDP ratio over time.

### Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio soaring above above all other countries
I chose the line chart because I wanted to see in one place, how the different countries stacked up and if there were any outliers. After transforming the data to look at all countries' ratio on a single line chart. It was clear how drastic Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio was above all others since the early 2000s. I decided to build a visualization that highlights Japan's values. I made Japan pink to stand out as the outlier and gave all the other countries a grey color to be placed in the background for comparison. Similarly, the overall average line is colored black so that it looks like secondary information, but is still viewable for comparison. Lastly, I added a clear title that will draw the reader to the message of the visualization. 

This chart is not the cleanest. The single line graph is still crowded with overlayed lines that are hard to read, however I think it is a direction towards displaying Japan as an outlier, which you cannot quite see on the sparkline charts.

### Part 4: Many countries trending towards financial instability in recent years
Lastly, we have a Tableau table that displays the general government debt-to-GDP ratio for all countries between 1995-2021. The table uses color to identify low and high values. The colored cells guide the readers eyes to see the trends in the value overall and for each individual country. This table is a nice way to present the numbers clearly, but also communicate trends using color.

Overall, each visualization has a unique method of communicating the general government debt-to-GDP ratio. The story that you are trying to communicate with the data will help decide which visualization is best.
