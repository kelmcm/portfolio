1,"This table contains long-run estimates of economic variables for the provinces and territories. The data are assembled in a fashion that facilitates examinations of economic performance over extended time horizons. Estimates contained in the dataset relate to prices, income and population. The data were originally compiled for the following research paper: M. Brown and R. Macdonald, 2015, Provincial Convergence and Divergence in Canada, 1926 to 2011, Statistics Canada Catalogue no. 11F0027M, Ottawa, Ontario, Economic Analysis Research Paper Series, no. 096.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, aggregations of Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut or of the Northwest Territories including Nunavut are presented to extend the data available for these units.

5,"Sigma is the standard deviation of the observations. It is calculated for two groups of provinces. The first group consists of all 10 provinces. For years before 1949, Newfoundland and Labrador is not present. The second group consists of all provinces except for Alberta, Saskatchewan and, after 1996, Newfoundland and Labrador. These provinces are excluded because their behaviour is associated with the convergence-divergence dynamic across provinces. For more information, see M. Brown and R. Macdonald, 2015, Provincial Convergence and Divergence in Canada, 1926 to 2011, Statistics Canada Catalogue no. 11F0027M, Ottawa, Ontario, Economic Analysis Research Paper Series, no. 096.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
