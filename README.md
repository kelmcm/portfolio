&#128075;Hello, I’m Kelly! 

My name is Kelly McManus and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a Massachusetts raised, Québec and Pennsylvania educated analyst who empowers individuals to harness data to make informed decisions, test hypotheses, and solve impactful problems. 

I am a data engineer and analyst who works from end-to-end throughout the data pipeline. I work with executives and product managers to understand business needs, collaborate with developers to design database architecture, and finally build any models required to deliver visualizations and actionable insights back to the company.

Currently, I am back in academia and studying for my Master of Information Systems Management, Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University.

This portfolio displays my work for the course Telling Stories With Data (94-870) that I took in Fall 2022 at Carnegie Mellon, Heinz College. 

## What I hope to learn

### What I hope to learn from this class
I'm taking the Telling Stories With Data course to gain more experience building data visualizations that are easy to read and highly insightful. 

By the end of this course, I hope to be in an expert in:

1. _Creating simple, impactful visualizations._ \
I have learned the hard way how NOT to build visualizations. While I was a data analyst, I made mistakes creating dashboards that were cluttered with uncessary information and overwhelmed the audiance with color. This negatively impacted the companies I worked for as these unusable dashboards still contained valuable insights that were never used to help the company. In the future, I hope to be more thoughtful in the way I communicate information in data visualizations so that the stories they tell are applied to company strategy. 
2. _Gathering user feedback_. \
I am also taking this class to learn how to extract actionable feedback from users so that I can improve my data visualizations. Each time I make a dashboard or chart, I always show the user and ask for feedback. However, the feedback I get is far too often "Wow, that looks great!". Sometimes the dashboard is used, while other times it is not. I would like to learn the right questions to ask users in order to extract actionable feedback that will help improve my data visualizations and increase the chance they will have an impact on the business. 

### What I plan to do after I graduate
After graduating, I will start working as a data engineer on an experimentation team. Typically, a data engineering role can be extreamly technical, however, my experience working as an analyst and collaborating with data consumers has led me to work on a technical team that has high visibility across the organization and direct contact with our end users. Somedays, I will be deep in a Python notebook trying to calculate an experimentation metric or training a model. While other days, I will be building a slide deck to explain an experimentation technique or creating a dashboard to analyze experiment results. Data visualizations will be a large part of my role and communicating data correctly will allow my team, my company, and myself to be successful.
