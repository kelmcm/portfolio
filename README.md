&#128075;Hello, I’m Kelly! 

My name is Kelly McManus and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a Massachusetts raised, Québec and Pennsylvania educated analyst who empowers individuals to harness data to make informed decisions, test hypotheses, and solve impactful problems. 

I am a data engineer and analyst who works from end-to-end throughout the data pipeline. I work with executives and product managers to understand business needs, collaborate with developers to design database architecture, and finally build any models required to deliver visualizations and actionable insights back to the company.

Currently, I am back in academia and studying for my Master of Information Systems Management, Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University.

This portfolio displays some of my work from school and life. 

### What I plan to do after I graduate
After graduating, I will start working as a data engineer on an experimentation team. Typically, a data engineering role can be extremely technical, however, my experience working as an analyst and collaborating with data consumers has led me to work on a technical team that has high visibility across the organization and direct contact with our end users. Some days, I will be deep in a Python notebook trying to calculate an experimentation metric or training a model. While other days, I will be building a slide deck to explain an experimentation technique or creating a dashboard to analyze experiment results. Data visualizations will be a large part of my role and communicating data correctly will allow my team, my company, and myself to be successful.
