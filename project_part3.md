In this project, I hoped to tell the story of the Newfoundland cod moratorium and the impact it has had on the people of Newfoundland and their culture. The hope was to warn others of the dangers of technology aiding in commercializing an industry too quickly as it did for the cod fishery. Technology can be a great tool, but it can also be a downfall. This was an iteratively developed project in three parts. 

Prior to coming to the final artifact, I completed Parts 1 and 2. In [Part 1](project.md), I developed and outlined of the story, sketched out the key visualizations I intended to weave into story, and I began gathering data sources. In [Part 2](project_part2.md), I developed a wireframe of my story on Shorthand, built the visualizations with Flourish, and conducted interviews to gather feedback on my draft story.

In this final iteration of my project, I gathered the feedback from my research interviews and implemented changes into my draft project to develop my final version. You can view the final version of the project on [Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/newfoundland-cod-moratorium/index.html). 

### Identifying the audience
For my final story, the target audience remains the same as my previous iterations. I hope to reach out to:

- Young, Canadians interested in learning more about their country's history, and
- Young, non-Canadians who care about their local community and want to preserve their heritage's traditions.

The story of Newfoundland is quite niche, but I believe that those who are unfamiliar with the region can still connect and learn from the history. This started to be apparent in my interviews with Americans as they learned about the cod moratorium and were intrigued by the message. 

### Building the final artifact

#### Key insights from interviews informed final adjustments
During my interviews, there were a few themes that came through: 
- Provide **deeper context** to the reader on the subject. I hope to add in additional context to help the reader understand the culture of Newfoundland and the fishery even if it is something they are not familiar with.
- Make **improvements to visualizations** to help understanding, rather than cause confusion. I hope to make a few corrections to the charts to ensure the message is communicated quickly to the reader.
- Include **additional data** sources to further build out the story. I hoped to include additional data and my own experiences to help further contextualize the story and answer any lingering questions.

Using these key insights, I was able to make adjustments to develop my final artifact.  

**Deeper context** adjustments
- Added a personal photo to discuss why I am interested in this topic and where the project inspiration came from. 
- Added a photo of an Atlantic cod to identify the species to readers who may not have prior knowledge about the fish. 
- Explained clearly where Newfoundland is located. 
- Included a summary section to provide the reader with a short synopsis of the article before they commit to reading.

**Improvements to visualizations** adjustments
- Used grey shaded areas, rather than vertical dotted lines to show the cod moratorium was over a period of years and is still in effect. This clears up confusion from interviews that the moratorium was in the 1900s. 
- Added a legend to the dual axis chart to communicate the line values. 
- Transferred the network chart on migration to a map built with kepler.gl. This tool allows the reader to visually see where the migrants went as well as see the width of the arcs depending on number of migrants. I tried to embed the HTML directly into Shorthand, but it was too heavy and froze the website. Instead, I added the static photo, with a link to the interactive map HTML page that is hosted on my Github. 

**Additional data** adjustments
- Added culture facts in the writing (screech-in, history on the founding of the colony) to provide context on Newfoundland society and values.
- I _did not_ integrate economic data into the story. I struggled to find a good dataset on the economic factors of Newfoundland. I have a dataset on long-term median yearly income per household from Statistics Canada, however I am still a bit confused about how this value is measured and if it is correctly calculated. I was hoping to find data on Newfoundland's GDP, but only found very recent years. Therefore, I decided to leave this out of the story. Due to this omission, there is a gap in discussing the economic impacts of the moratorium. In a further iteration, I would hope to do more research to find a solid dataset that showcases how the moratorium impacted the province.

#### Design decisions
I tried to keep the layout of the story rather simple. I chose a white background with black text to emulate a blog article or newspaper. I included only two full picture bands in the story to highlight the fishing town of Bonavista and the interactive map. I tried to make sure that there was only one visualization at a time with some complimentary text in the view of the readers eye as they scroll through the web page. This was to not cause confusion and overload the reader with too much information at once. 


### Improvements for future iterations
As discussed above, there is still some work to be done to tell the complete story of the cod moratorium. The next steps are: 
- Find reliable economic data on Newfoundland before and after the cod moratorium. 
- Dig deeper into resettlement data and better highlight how the changes in the fishery impacted people's lives. 
- Find a better IUU fishing dataset. The dataset I have only shows citations during the 80s and 90s. Illegal, unregulated, and unreported data is extremely hard to find because it is, by nature, unreported. There is work being done to use computer vision to track IUU fishing, this would not be something available at the time of the moratorium, but would be interesting to see if it still is happening in this region and if it is having an impact of the regrowth of the cod stock. 

Overall, finding reliable data for this project was a major challenge as many of Newfoundland records are not online in clean CSV tables. Next steps would be to dig into the offline records to uncover interesting data that may provide clarity on the causes and effects of the cod moratorium.
