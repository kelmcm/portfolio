# Telling Stories With Data

Carnegie Mellon University 

Fall 2022

## Course
I took Telling Stories with Data (94-870) in Fall 2022 with Prof. Christopher Goranson. This course was the information of the portfolio. We learned about Github pages and how to set up a portfolio. The crux of the class was about data visualization and how they can be used to communicate information. 

## What I hope to learn
I'm taking the Telling Stories With Data course to gain more experience building data visualizations that are easy to read and highly insightful.

By the end of this course, I hope to be in an expert in:

1. _Creating simple, impactful visualizations._ \
   I have learned the hard way how NOT to build visualizations. While I was a data analyst, I made mistakes creating dashboards that were cluttered with uncessary information and overwhelmed the audiance with color. This negatively impacted the companies I worked for as these unusable dashboards still contained valuable insights that were never used to help the company. In the future, I hope to be more thoughtful in the way I communicate information in data visualizations so that the stories they tell are applied to company strategy.
2. _Gathering user feedback_. \
   I am also taking this class to learn how to extract actionable feedback from users so that I can improve my data visualizations. Each time I make a dashboard or chart, I always show the user and ask for feedback. However, the feedback I get is far too often "Wow, that looks great!". Sometimes the dashboard is used, while other times it is not. I would like to learn the right questions to ask users in order to extract actionable feedback that will help improve my data visualizations and increase the chance they will have an impact on the business.
