# Assignment 3&4: Critique by design

## Step 1: Finding a design
For this critique, I chose to review a few of the key charts that Statistics Canada has shared from the recent 2021 census. Language can be a divisive subject in Canada, in particularly Quebec. Canada has two official languages: English and French. In recent years, Quebec has been worried about the increasing number of English speakers in their province. 

The below two charts, are the *main* visualizations Statistics Canada used to communicate the current state of language in Quebec. 

In Quebec, the relative proportion of individuals who speak predominantly French at home has been decreasing since 2001

In Quebec, the number of individuals whose first official language spoken is English tops the 1 million mark

These visualizations were cited in new stories from the [CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/statistics-canada-language-census-2021-1.6553939#:~:text=CBC%20News%20Loaded-,Smaller%20share%20of%20Quebec%20households%20speaking%20French%20regularly%2C%20census%20data,percentage%20points%20in%20five%20years.) and [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-proportion-of-french-speakers-in-canada-declines-everywhere-except/) and were also used for analyses by the [Quebec Provincial Government](https://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/sociolinguistique/2022/Feuillet_Car-ling-pop-Quebec-2021.pdf). 

A third chart, showing bilingualism in Quebec was also communicated, but less widely spread. 

The English-French bilingualism rate has been increasing in Quebec and declining outside Quebec since 2001

Right away, looking at these three graphics, I see the claim that French is on the decline and English is on the rise, however bilingualism is also increasing? These contradictory messages prompted me to critique these visualizations, analyze the underlying data, and see if the claim is truly justified or if the visualizations are skewing myself and other reader's perceptions on the decline of the French language in Quebec.

Overall, these two visualizations are neither unreadable nor unusable, they communicate the information they hold in a straightforward manner. However, there are two elements that give me pause that make these visualizations hard to compare, even though these two visualizations are commonly shown side by side in news articles and media.

### Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently?

The first difference is that the values are showing two different metrics: Number of people who speak French at home vs. Number of people whose first language spoken is English. It's a slight difference between the terminology of these metrics, but as a reader it can be confusing to understand these definitions and differences between the values. Secondly, while these charts are often shown together, their axis have different scales. At a quick glance, a reader may not see the different scales and attribute a larger increase in English language and a smaller decrease in French.

I do like that these charts are trying to stay simple. There is not too much text on the charts and there is a lot of white space, allowing the reader to be able to piece together the puzzle of what the are trying to convey. Similarly, each of these charts have great descriptive titles that guys the reader to interpret the data rather quickly.

Overall, the things I would change are:
- Use the same metric for both English and French to compare apples to apples.
- Have the same axis scales. To really compare the values, the axis scales should be the same to visually see a realistic picture.
- Remove the double axis. Potentially, using a stacked bar chart to show the entire population compared to the French population may be a good way to show the raw count but allow the reader to get an idea of the proportion of the population without using a second axis.

I would keep:
- White space. I would want to keep the graph easy to read and not overcluttered.
- Descriptive title. This is a great tool to guide the reader towards the insight from the graph.

### Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not? 
The audience of this visualization is the general Canadian population. Journalists and statisticians will be the primary consumers of this visualization, but as Statistics Canada is the federal government's data arm, they should prepare for anyone in the general population to view this information. Those who are particularly interest in the language demographics of the population will also pay close attention to this visualization. I do not think this visualization is effective in communicating to such a broad audience who may or may not be familiar with reading charts. For example, the double vertical axis is a feature that is more geared to readers who are used to reading visualizations. If you are unfamiliar with how a double axis works, this may be confusing to read. Similarly, the text on these charts is extremally small and may be hard to read for people who poor eyesight. Using one axis per chart and having larger text to improve legibility are some things that can be improved on the visualization to become more accessible to the entire Canadian population.
