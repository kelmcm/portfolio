# Assignment 3&4: Critique by design

## Step 1: Finding a design
For this critique, I chose to review a few of the key charts that Statistics Canada has shared from the recent 2021 census. Language can be a divisive subject in Canada, in particularly Quebec. Canada has two official languages: English and French. In recent years, Quebec has been worried about the increasing number of English speakers in their province. 

The below two charts, are the *main* visualizations Statistics Canada used to communicate the current state of language in Quebec. 

In Quebec, the relative proportion of individuals who speak predominantly French at home has been decreasing since 2001

In Quebec, the number of individuals whose first official language spoken is English tops the 1 million mark

These visualizations were cited in new stories from the [CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/statistics-canada-language-census-2021-1.6553939#:~:text=CBC%20News%20Loaded-,Smaller%20share%20of%20Quebec%20households%20speaking%20French%20regularly%2C%20census%20data,percentage%20points%20in%20five%20years.) and [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-proportion-of-french-speakers-in-canada-declines-everywhere-except/) and were also used for analyses by the [Quebec Provincial Government](https://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/sociolinguistique/2022/Feuillet_Car-ling-pop-Quebec-2021.pdf). 

A third chart, showing bilingualism in Quebec was also communicated, but less widely spread. 

The English-French bilingualism rate has been increasing in Quebec and declining outside Quebec since 2001

Right away, looking at these three graphics, I see the claim that French is on the decline and English is on the rise, however bilingualism is also increasing? These contradictory messages prompted me to critique these visualizations, analyze the underlying data, and see if the claim is truly justified or if the visualizations are skewing myself and other reader's perceptions on the decline of the French language in Quebec.
