# Wireframe

The wireframe was built directly on Shorthand and is accessible at this link: https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/newfoundland-cod-moratorium-draft/embed.js

I decided to keep a very simple wireframe with not a lot of variation in the format of text and images. This was intentional to get feedback on the story and the visualizations from my interviewees. After making improvements to the story and visualizations, I may add in more dynamic content in the final iteration.

# User research

## Protocol

**Audience**

The target audience for this story is non-Newfoundlanders who vote in local elections. I hope to educate individuals on the power of giving your say at a local level to help their community. 

**Interview script**

I will use a similar interview format as we did for our previous assignment: 
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Is there anything missing that you want to see?

## Findings

### Interview #1: Canadian, mid-20s

Can you tell me what you think this is?


Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Telling me about the hisotry of cod fishing in Newfoundland. 
- How there was overfishing, had to implement moratorium to save cod population
- As a result, lots of newfounalnder left

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- The first graph shows the opposite, introduces the decline before the story gets there. Misplaced.
- Why doesnt the second graph stop at 1960?
- Third graph, fishing citations decrease after cod moratorium. Title doesn't show exactly what the graph is showing.
- It looks like the cod moratorium is in the dotted lines, not clear that it starts in 1992. 
- The migrants graph is nice, but its too overlapping. 
- Orange / blue line graph you cant tell which line is which. 
- Nothing surprising, because im know of the story
- The stalk not really recovering is surprising

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Other Canadains, not from Newfoundland, learning about Canada
- Fisherman maybe

Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Maybe reposition some of the graphs and the story
- The first graph may need data going further, save the decline for below. 

Is there anything missing that you want to see?
- How bout like income of people overtime, Household income median family?

### Interview #2: American, late-20s.
Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Once Newfoundland joined Canada, changes occured in the economy which resulted in fish depletion and cod moratorium. People moved away. 

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- I had to re-read the cod moratorium part multiple times because it was so abruptly mentioned 
- I didn't understand about the citations vs. depleted cod post moratorium. Looks like people were fishing a lot during the cod mortorium 
- The cod moratorium is between 1950 and 1990?
- Network graph is cool, but id like to see numeric lables.
- How many people live in Newfoundland, it's unclear the context of the network graph
- Why havent the fish come back?

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- This seems like a Vox article or new york times
- Socially contious people below 40 and above 20

Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Add US to the map
- More contrast on the yellow and green on the map

Is there anything missing that you want to see?
- Maybe you can have a table contents at the top 

Do you find this interesting as a non-Canadain?
- Maybe? Need more context about Canada for non-Canadians to understand. 

What's your main takeaway?
- I thought it was cool and something I didn't know about or hear about. 
- That joining Canada was a bad decision for Newfoundland

### Interview #3:

## Changes to implement
