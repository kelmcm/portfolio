# Final Project: Visualizing the Impact of the Cod Moratorium on Newfoundland
## Part 2: Wireframe and user research

# Wireframe

The wireframe was built directly on Shorthand and is accessible at this link: https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/newfoundland-cod-moratorium-draft/embed.js

I decided to keep a very simple wireframe with not a lot of variation in the format of text and images. This was intentional to get feedback on the story and the visualizations from my interviewees. After making improvements to the story and visualizations, I may add in more dynamic content in the final iteration.

# User research

## Protocol

**Audience and personas**

The target audience for this story is broadly non-Newfoundlanders who vote in local elections. I hope to educate individuals on the power of giving your say at a local level to help their community. 

Within this broad category, there are two main personas of readers that I am hoping to connect with throughout my story:

- Persona #1: Young Canadians interested in learning more about their country's history
- Persona #2: Young non-Canadians who care about their local community and want to preserve their heritage's traditions.

**Interview script**

I will use a similar interview format as we did for our previous assignment: 
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Is there anything missing that you want to see?

Depending on the interviewee, there will some variations. 

**Finding interviewees**

I reached out to both Canadian and American friends who are in their early career from various backgrounds who may or may not care about their local community. 

## Findings

### Interview #1: Canadian, mid-20s, medical student. 

Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Telling me about the history of cod fishing in Newfoundland. 
- How there was overfishing, had to implement moratorium to save cod population
- As a result, lots of Newfoundlanders left

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- The first graph shows the opposite, introduces the decline before the story gets there. Misplaced.
- Why doesn't the second graph stop at 1960?
- Third graph, fishing citations decrease after cod moratorium. Title doesn't show exactly what the graph is showing.
- It looks like the cod moratorium is in the dotted lines, not clear that it starts in 1992. 
- The migrants graph is nice, but it's too overlapping. 
- Orange / blue line graph you cant tell which line is which. 
- Nothing surprising, because I know of the story
- The stalk not really recovering is surprising

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Other Canadians, not from Newfoundland, learning about Canada
- Fisherman maybe

Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Maybe reposition some graphs and the story
- The first graph may need data going further, save the decline for below. 

Is there anything missing that you want to see?
- How bout like income of people overtime, Household income median family?

### Interview #2: American, late-20s, finance analyst.
Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Once Newfoundland joined Canada, changes occurred in the economy which resulted in fish depletion and cod moratorium. People moved away. 

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- I had to re-read the cod moratorium part multiple times because it was so abruptly mentioned 
- I didn't understand about the citations vs. depleted cod post moratorium. Looks like people were fishing a lot during the cod moratorium 
- The cod moratorium is between 1950 and 1990?
- Network graph is cool, but id like to see numeric labels.
- How many people live in Newfoundland, it's unclear the context of the network graph
- Why haven't the fish come back?

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- This seems like a Vox article or new york times
- Socially conscious people below 40 and above 20

Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Add US to the map
- More contrast on the yellow and green on the map

Is there anything missing that you want to see?
- Maybe you can have a table contents at the top 

Do you find this interesting as a non-Canadian?
- Maybe? Need more context about Canada for non-Canadians to understand. 

What's your main takeaway?
- I thought it was cool and something I didn't know about or hear about. 
- That joining Canada was a bad decision for Newfoundland

### Interview #3: American, early 20s, data science student. 

Can you describe to me what this is telling you? 
- Talking about the fishing industry in Newfoundland and how it had an impact on the cod population, specifically after Newfoundland joined Canada. 

Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? 
- The first graph after the map is supposed to show that fishing has been a big part of the economy, but it's going down. 
- The bubble graph didn't make sense, what do the bubbles mean? Some bubbles are the same size
- Weird that the graph stops at 1960s. 
- Nothing surprising, the data is surprising, i didn't know it declined so significantly. 
- It's sad that it's barely coming back after the moratorium. 

Who do you think is the intended audience for this? 
- People of Newfoundland or in the surrounding areas because at the end you include ways to help the industry and discusses local stuff. 
- There's nothing I can do from here because I can't get Newfoundland cod. 

Is there anything you would change or do differently? 
- No, just the bubble graph. 

Is there anything missing that you want to see?
- Not necessarily, you could expand a bit more on the factors that contributed to the decline. Which ones had a higher correlation to contribute to the decline, local fishing or sea temperatures.

## Changes to implement
The interviews highlighted some key changes that I need to make to create a more streamlined, understandable story: 
- _Fix the first chart after the map:_ The current chart does not communicate how important the fishery was in Newfoundlanders lives and economy in the 1800s and 1900s. The downwards sloping line begs questions as to why the fishery is in decline before the cod moratorium is introduced. 
- _Add a one-sentence summary at the top_ : Readers will be able to see if they are interested in the topic before committing to reading the full article. 
- _Better chart type for migrants network chart_: I would like to make this visualization a bit clearer. I will create a static version of this visualization on Figma to clearer show the movement of migrants away from Newfoundland to other provinces. 
- _Add a chart on average income over time:_ Some of my interviewees had questions about seeing data on the economic impact. I w
- _Add labels to the cod population/Newfoundland population double axis chart_: My interviewers were not able to differentiate between the two lines. I will add labels to make this clearer. 
- _Add US to the map_: This will be to give readers who are not familiar with Canada more context on where Newfoundland is in the world.

### Feedback from in-class critique
- _Add more variation in the style of content_: I chose to purposely simplify the wireframe to focus on the stories and visualizations
- _Easter transitions between content_: My team discussed a lot about how we are integrating the data and visualizations to our story. In the final
