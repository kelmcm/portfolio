## Protocol

**Audience**

The target audience for this story is non-Newfoundlanders who vote in local elections. I hope to educate individuals on the power of giving your say at a local level to help their community. 

**Interview script**

I will use a similar interview format as we did for our previous assignment: 
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Is there anything missing that you want to see?
