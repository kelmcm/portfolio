# Final Project: Visualizing the Impact of the Cod Moratorium on Newfoundland

## Outline

**High-level summary**: Technology and economic security are great until it takes all your fish and you are forced to leave your home. 

**User stories**: 
- As a reader, I want to know the mistakes of the past, so that I can vote/make better decision in the future. 
- As a reader, I want to know how to protect my culture so that my kids can grow up in a world like me. 

**Call to action**: 
- I can do this by voting for politicians who support local industry. 
- I can do this by buying from local/non-commercial companies. 

### Setup 
_The fishery is a huge part of Newfoundland culture and economy._ 

Newfoundland was doing poorly, so they decided to join Canada for economic security...

The cod industry took off and open for new commercial business...

But, the commercial cod fishery was too effective...

### Conflict
_The decline of the cod fishery due to commercialization had a negative impact on lives of Newfoundlanders._
- Decline of cod population
- Loss of jobs after cod moratorium

Poor regulations and IUU led to a drastic depletion in the cod industry...

Led the government to do a cod moratorium in 1992 as a last resort to keep the current cod population...

Cod is "vulnerable to extinction" (https://oceana.org/marine-life/atlantic-cod/#:~:text=Scientists%20agree%20that%20North%20Atlantic,currently%20considered%20vulnerable%20to%20extinction.)

The death of the cod fishery forced people to leave their homes and move away...[Map of # of people who left Newfoundland with lines to where they went]

It's not just the cod fishery, this has happened in other industries and places like...

### Resolution
_Buying from local companies and voting for politicians who support local industry will help solve this problem._

Support local fisherman. Buy local seafood and products. 

## Sketches

## Data

This project will incorporate a number of complementary datasets to tell the story of Newfoundland's cod industry. 

Datasets: 
- Northern cod yearly catches, 1508-2019 <br><br>

    This dataset displays yearly cod catches for the past five centuries. Catches are often used as an estimate for fish population as it is impossible to track the total number of fish in the ocean. The dataset was constructed from two separate sources, NAFO annual reports and DFO stock status updates, for the Journal of Marine Science and was published in 2021. The dataset is publicly accessible in the supplementary data of the article. <br><br>

- Newfoundland population, 1971 to 2021 <br><br>

  This dataset displays Newfoundland's yearly population between 1971 and 2021 from Statistics Canada. The data will be used to compare similar trends between fluctuation in yearly cod catches and the Newfoundland population. <br><br>

  Statistics Canada. Table 17-10-0005-01  Population estimates on July 1st, by age and sex, https://doi.org/10.25318/1710000501-eng <br><br>

- Newfoundland migration <br><br>

  Along with population data, viewing the yearly migrations of people out of Newfoundland will also help to tell the story of the negative impact the cod moratorium had on the province. This dataset displays the number of people that moved from Newfoundland to another Canadian province each year. I hope to present a map that visually represents the geographic relocation of Newfoundlanders due to the cod moratorium. <br><br>

- Post-joining Canada: Economic impact metrics <br><br>

  Newfoundland was its own country until 1949 when it joined Canada. Finding data on Newfoundland before it was a part of Canada can be hard. One metric that Canada uses to track long-term economic performance is household income per capita. I will be using this data to analyze the economic impact of joining Canada and the cod moratorium on Newfoundland. <br><br>
