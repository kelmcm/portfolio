# Final Project: Visualizing the Impact of the Cod Moratorium on Newfoundland

## Outline

**High-level summary**: Technology and economic security are great until it takes all your fish and you are forced to leave your home. 

**User stories**: 
- As a reader, I want to know the mistakes of the past, so that I can vote/make better decision in the future. 
- As a reader, I want to know how to protect my culture so that my kids can grow up in a world like me. 

**Call to action**: 
- I can do this by voting for politicians who support local industry. 
- I can do this by buying from local/non-commercial companies. 

### Setup 
_The fishery is a huge part of Newfoundland culture and economy._ 

Newfoundland was doing poorly, so they decided to join Canada for economic security...

The cod industry took off and open for new commercial business...

But, the commercial cod fishery was too effective...

### Conflict
_The decline of the cod fishery due to commercialization had a negative impact on lives of Newfoundlanders._
- Decline of cod population
- Loss of jobs after cod moratorium

Poor regulations and IUU led to a drastic depletion in the cod industry...

Led the government to do a cod moratorium in 1992 as a last resort to keep the current cod population...

Cod is "vulnerable to extinction" (https://oceana.org/marine-life/atlantic-cod/#:~:text=Scientists%20agree%20that%20North%20Atlantic,currently%20considered%20vulnerable%20to%20extinction.)

The death of the cod fishery forced people to leave their homes and move away...[Map of # of people who left Newfoundland with lines to where they went]

It's not just the cod fishery, this has happened in other industries and places like...

### Resolution
_Buying from local companies and voting for politicians who support local industry will help solve this problem._

Support local fisherman. Buy local seafood and products.
